## How to use this module?

This directory defines a [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
[module](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html) you can use in your
existing [stack](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#stack) by adding a
`module` configuration and setting its `source` parameter to URL of this folder:

```hcl
module "signalfx-detectors-smart-agent-kubernetes-apiserver" {
  source = "github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors.git//modules/smart-agent_kubernetes-apiserver?ref={revision}"

  environment   = var.environment
  notifications = local.notifications
}
```

Note the following parameters:

* `source`: Use this parameter to specify the URL of the module. The double slash (`//`) is intentional  and required.
  Terraform uses it to specify subfolders within a Git repo (see [module
  sources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html)). The `ref` parameter specifies a specific Git tag in
  this repository. It is recommended to use the latest "pinned" version in place of `{revision}`. Avoid using a branch
  like `master` except for testing purpose. Note that every modules in this repository are available on the Terraform
  [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/claranet/detectors/signalfx) and we recommend using it as source
  instead of `git` which is more flexible but less future-proof.

* `environment`: Use this parameter to specify the
  [environment](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Getting-started#environment) used by this
  instance of the module.
  Its value will be added to the `prefixes` list at the start of the [detector
  name](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Templating#example).
  In general, it will also be used in the `filtering` internal sub-module to [apply
  filters](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance#filtering) based on our default
  [tagging convention](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Tagging-convention) by default.

* `notifications`: Use this parameter to define where alerts should be sent depending on their severity. It consists
  of a Terraform [object](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/types.html#object-) where each key represents an
  available [detector rule severity](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/detect-alert/set-up-detectors.html#severity)
  and its value is a list of recipients. Every recipients must respect the [detector notification
  format](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/splunk-terraform/signalfx/latest/docs/resources/detector#notification-format).
  Check the [notification binding](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Notifications-binding)
  documentation to understand the recommended role of each severity.

These 3 parameters alongs with all variables defined in [common-variables.tf](common-variables.tf) are common to all
[modules](../) in this repository. Other variables, specific to this module, are available in
[variables.tf](variables.tf).
In general, the default configuration "works" but all of these Terraform
[variables](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html) make it possible to
customize the detectors behavior to better fit your needs.

Most of them represent usual tips and rules detailled in the
[guidance](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Guidance) documentation and listed in the
common [variables](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki/Variables) dedicated documentation.

Feel free to explore the [wiki](https://github.com/claranet/terraform-signalfx-detectors/wiki) for more information about
general usage of this repository.

## What are the available detectors in this module?

This module creates the following SignalFx detectors which could contain one or multiple alerting rules:

|Detector|Critical|Major|Minor|Warning|Info|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Kubernetes API server heartbeat|X|-|-|-|-|

## How to collect required metrics?

This module uses metrics available from
[monitors](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/_monitor-config.html)
available in the [SignalFx Smart
Agent](https://github.com/signalfx/signalfx-agent). Check the [Related documentation](#related-documentation) section for more
information including the official documentation of this monitor.


Follow the
[kubernetes-apiserver](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/monitors/kubernetes-apiserver.html)
monitor configuration to collect metrics.


### Metrics


To filter only required metrics for the detectors of this module, add the
[datapointsToExclude](https://docs.signalfx.com/en/latest/integrations/agent/filtering.html) parameter to
the corresponding monitor configuration:

```yaml
    datapointsToExclude:
      - metricNames:
        - '*'
        - '!apiserver_request_total'

```

## Notes

For now this module only contains an heartbeat detector to check the health of the api server.

As for any control plane components you should enable alerting notifications only when you host the master
nodes yourself. In general, we do not want to trigger alerts on components we don't manage.

That said, it remains possible to configure the monitor to retrieve metrics from a full managed cluster like `GKE`
for metrology purpose and even deploy these detectors without oncall notifications to check for the underlying
provider availability.
